# [Live Demo](https://staadecker.github.io/triangles/)

At this demo all the particles follow essentially one rule: move yourself such that you form an equilateral triangle with your two pre-selected "linked" particles.

The system often does not reach a stable equilibrium, showing how simple rules can result in chaos.

The idea to complete this simulation came from a classroom activity where students were asked to move around the room to form an equilateral triangle with two other people of their choice in the room.
